   ### Purpose
   To prepare a new . 
   The data will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output so have used unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, Martha decided on a clustering algorithm. And, to use data visualizations to share findings with the company's board.
  
   The deliverables are: 
   - Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PC
   - Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
   - Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
   - Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
